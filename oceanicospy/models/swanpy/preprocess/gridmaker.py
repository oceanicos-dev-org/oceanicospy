class GridMaker:
    """
    GridMaker is a utility class for generating and managing the grid information for SWAN.

    Parameters
    ----------
    init : object
        An initialization object containing configuration data and folder paths.
    domain_number : int
        Identifier for the domain being processed.
    grid_info : dict or None, optional
        User-provided grid information dictionary.
        If the grid_info dictionary is passed it should contain the following keys: 
        ``lon_ll_corner``: longitude of the lower-left corner of the grid
        ``lat_ll_corner``: latitude of the lower-left corner of the grid
        ``x_extent``: total extent of the grid in the x-direction (longitude)
        ``y_extent``: total extent of the grid in the y-direction (latitude)
        ``nx`` : number of grid cells in the x-direction
        ``ny``: number of grid cells in the y-direction
    dx : float or None, optional
        Grid spacing in the x-direction (longitude).
    dy : float or None, optional
        Grid spacing in the y-direction (latitude).

    Notes
    -----
    This class is used to generate and manage grid information for SWAN simulations.

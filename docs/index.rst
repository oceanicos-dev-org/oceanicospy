oceanicospy documentation
=========================

**oceanicospy** is a Python library for handling in-situ oceanographic data analysis,
reading observations from a diverse set of sensors, automating numerical modelling
workflows, downloading data from common sources, and working with GIS data.

In the folloing diagram, we show the high-level structure of the library, which is organized into subpackages
that group related functionality together.
